# About - process of creating **TriangleYAY**
I've never programmed in Lua. This is my first project that I created in under 24H and this is how I made it:
1. Learning basics of Lua and how it works in few minutes.
2. Learning how LÖVE. works - printing some random text on screen (examples from LÖVE homepage). It's similar to python so I've spent about 10-30 minutes.
3. Learning commands of LÖVE. This part was most time-drainful - few hours. I picked some commands that I will use.
4. Trying to display something different than text - worked at first try.
5. Understanding how to receive keyboard input - few minutes.
6. Added some window collisions - pretty easy, just used WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT variables - 10 minutes of coding.
7. Now it's part for more than 1 object - I added a "triangle" (it's a circle with 3 segments lol). Took me few minutes.
8. Understanding how collisions works on different objects - about 30-60 minutes.
9. Now the hardest part - creating multiple triangles and detecting collisions from them. I've spent about 4 hours to do it.
10. Adding some effects/shaders. GLSL syntax is more akin to C/C++ so... next few hours. Screen shaking was really easy to apply.
11. Time for music - sound effects are made with [bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/). Music is from random copy-right free websites.
12. Final.
